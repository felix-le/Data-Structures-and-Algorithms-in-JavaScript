# The all important coding interview.

1. Contact phase: 
- talk to recruiters
- friend refers you 
- submit your resume online

2. Interview phase: 
- Phone screen
- onsite Interview

## More phase:

1. Contact phase for understanding: 
- Who you are? 
- what did your work experience you have? 
- side projects
- social contacts

2. Culture fit?
- can you code? (take home assignment)

## Evaluating coding Ability

1. Take-home assignment: 
2. pair Programming at a computer
3. Whiteboard: presented your codes

## Example: Fizzbuzz question

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "Fizzbuzz".

- fibonacci an integer in the infinite sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦ of which the first two terms are 1 and 1 and each succeeding term is the sum of the two immediately preceding.

## Debugger

- wherever you want to check the bugs, you should write down the debugger statement. then cd to its folder.
- run command: 
```bash
$ node inspect "filename.js"
$ c
$ copy code
```

# Runtime complexity

Describes the performance of an algorithm. 


1. constant time - the algorithm will always take the same amount of time. O(1)
2. logarithmic time: search.
3. Linear time: if you see a for loop spanning from 0 to array length, you probably have 'n', or linear runtime. O(n)
4. Quasilinear time:
5. Quadratic time: every element in a collection has to be compared to each others. O(n^2)
6. Exponential time: if you add a "single" element to a collection, the processing power required doubles.

# Queue

Enqueuing or adding ==> dequeuing or removing.

First In First Out

F-I-F-O

## stack  
first in last out;
F-I-L-O

## Linked lists
- Is an ordered collection of data.
- it contains a number of different nodes and so on the screen right here you can see four separate nodes each node contains some amount of data along with reference to the next node.
