> The interview is much more looking at exactly how you communicate what you're  trying to say and exactly what areas you are focusing on when you're answering the questions.
>> How you would identify challenges in the product and then maybe interview or be B would want to hear about how you would scale out the product for hundreds of thousands or million users.

Examples:

> For Twitter, you might focus on how you would store tweets in the database or how you would store users in the database.

Should not focus on spouting off different frameworks or different technologies. 

> Well I would probably decide to use a web frameworks on the front end. Which could easily render out a list of tweets and maybe they would be a framework that would have to work very well in mobile if I expected my users to access this page frequently from a mobile device.
